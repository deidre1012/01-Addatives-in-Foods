Health is a constant focus in the lives of people.  What we eat, what exercises are the best, and what is the latest dieting techniques are several of the constant ways people try to stay "healthy."  What does healthy even mean?  Based on the Oxford dictionary healthy is defined as a body with none diseased cells, of healthy size, and fit.  In order to stay health the number one focus is what humans consume.  One of the leading controversies today within the food industry between farmers and consumers are the addatives in the food.  For example, hormones within the meats have been a widely debated topic for years.  However, despite the arguments of artifical hormones added to the animals to increase growth have been greatly exaggerated.  Based on the standards of the FDA, Food and Drug Administration, no artificial hormones are added to meats that are harmful for human consumption.  The only hormones added are the natural hormones that already exist witin the animals that assist in growth progress (FDA, 2017).  The amount of hormones that are used to help the growth of the animals are nothing to be concerned about for consumption.  The amount that the animals intake are regulated at a rate that is barely increased from what naturally is produced with the animals already.  Some of those hormones include estrodial, progesterone, and testosterone (FDA, 2017).  Hormones are added only to increase the meat/weight gain of the animals.  Same as humans, when we take in more calories, certain medicines, and proteins we are alterating our bodies in some way.  The same is for animals.  When they are give more to eat that food is then processed within its body into meat which later is consumed by humans.  That is the only purpose  of feeding more to the animals: to increase the meat which feeds more people, not to increase obesity or unhealthy foods for people to eat.
