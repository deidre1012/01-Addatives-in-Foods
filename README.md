## 01-Introductory Post

Health is a constant study in today's society.  Health has become a highly debated and discussed topic because of an increase in human obesity.  What people eat, what exercises are the best, and what is the latest dieting techniques are several of the constant ways people try to stay "healthy."  What does healthy mean?  Based on the Oxford dictionary healthy is defined as a body with none diseased cells, of healthy size, and fit.  In order to stay healthy the number one focus is what humans consume.  One of the leading controversies today within the food industry are the addatives in the food.  For example, hormones in meats has been a widely debated topic for years.  However, despite the arguments of artifical hormones added to meats in order to increase growth have been greatly exaggerated.  Based on the standards of the FDA, Food and Drug Administration, no artificial hormones are added to meats that are harmful for human consumption.  The only hormones added are the natural hormones that already exist witin the animals that assist in growth progress (FDA, 2017).  The amount of hormones used to increase the growth of the animals should not cause concern for the consumer.  The amount of hormones that the animals intake are regulated at a rate that is barely above what the animals already naturally produce.  Some of those hormones include estrodial, progesterone, and testosterone (FDA, 2017).  The hormone estrogen added to the cattle verses cattle with non-added estrogen only have a 0.35 nanogram per a three ounce serving (IGrow, 2015, Blair).  Hormones are added only to increase the meat/weight gain of the animals.  Same as humans, when we take in more calories, certain medicines, and proteins we are alterating our body's weight.  The same happens with animals.  When the animals are given more to eat the food is then processed within its body into meat which later is consumed by humans.  That is the only purpose  of feeding more to the animals: to increase the meat which feeds more people.  Feeding more to the animals is not to increase obesity or unhealthy foods for people to eat.  Throughout my following posts I will discuss different food addatives that are healthy and not healthy for humans to eat. 


# What's in the Meat?

Meat is the main source of protein humans can consume.  The main meats consumed are chicken, beef, and pork.  As humans have become more aware of the food they intake, meats are either avoided or the way in which they are raised is viewed as inhumane or harmful to human consumption.  As previously stated in the introductory post, no artifical hormones are injected into the meats.  There are natural hormones fed/njected into the animals which allow for them to grow more and without being harmful to humans.  The main hormone in beef is estrogen.  In a three ounce serving there is 1.2 nanograms in an hormone injected steer compared to a non-injected steer at 0.85 nanograms.  Each choice of beef is healthy for human consumption.  The amount of protein in a grass fed steer versus a grain fed steer is 21.8 grams to 22.6 grams (Beef it's Whats for Dinner).  Therefore, despite what beef product chosen to eat is not harmful.  Unlike beef that can be injected with natural hormones, chickens are not injected or fed any type of hormones.  The reason for the increased size of chickens from the mid 1950s to today is the environment in which the chickens are raised.  With the ability to better care for the chickens allows for their growth rate to increase.  In the chicken houses the temperature is one way to regulate the growth.  During the middle of winter, the chicken houses are able to be kept at warm temperatures to not affect the chickens.  Also, the housing is able to allow the owners to feed with more consistent times.  With just these two conditions, temperature and regulated feeding, the growth of the chicken is able to increase (The Truth About Hormone Free Chickens).  Thus, making it from hatching to processing a quicker and easier process.  Just like chicken, pork is prohibited to have hormones injected by USDA regulations (FSIS-USDA).  Therefore, the three main meats consumed are all raised in a safe and healthy environment for humans.  In 2017, statistics show that 25.8 kilograms per captia of beef, 48.8 kilograms per captia of poultry, and 23.6 kilograms per captia of pork was consumed (OECD).  Therefore, meats are still highly consumed by humans and have no harmful effects.
