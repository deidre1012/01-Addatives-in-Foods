# What's in the Meat?

Meat is the main source of protein humans can consume.  The main meats consumed are chicken, beef, and pork.  As humans have become more aware of the food they intake, meats are either avoided or the way in which they are raised is viewed as inhumane or harmful to human consumption.  As previously stated in the introductory post, no artifical hormones are injected into the meats.  There are natural hormones fed/njected into the animals which allow for them to grow more and without being harmful to humans.  The main hormone in beef is estrogen.  In a three ounce serving there is 1.2 nanograms in an hormone injected steer compared to a non-injected steer at 0.85 nanograms.  Each choice of beef is healthy for human consumption.  The amount of protein in a grass fed steer versus a grain fed steer is 21.8 grams to 22.6 grams (Beef it's Whats for Dinner).  Therefore, despite what beef product chosen to eat is not harmful.  Unlike beef that can be injected with natural hormones, chickens are not injected or fed any type of hormones.  The reason for the increased size of chickens from the mid 1950s to today is the environment in which the chickens are raised.  With the ability to better care for the chickens allows for their growth rate to increase.  In the chicken houses the temperature is one way to regulate the growth.  During the middle of winter, the chicken houses are able to be kept at warm temperatures to not affect the chickens.  Also, the housing is able to allow the owners to feed with more consistent times.  With just these two conditions, temperature and regulated feeding, the growth of the chicken is able to increase (The Truth About Hormone Free Chickens).  Thus, making it from hatching to processing a quicker and easier process.  Just like chicken, pork is prohibited to have hormones injected by USDA regulations (FSIS-USDA).  Therefore, the three main meats consumed are all raised in a safe and healthy environment for humans.  In 2017, statistics show that 25.8 kilograms per captia of beef, 48.8 kilograms per captia of poultry, and 23.6 kilograms per captia of pork was consumed (OECD).  Therefore, meats are still highly consumed by humans and have no harmful effects.
